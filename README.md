Servy is a humble HTTP Server written in Elixir for the Pragmatic Studio's Elixir & OTP course.

Servy features 
- Heavy use of pattern matching
- File and Socket IO
- Handling state with GenServer
- Using Supervisor to immediately recover from failures ðŸ™Œ
- Handling requests in concurrent processes 

## Relevant project files

A good entry point of the project would be checking the [Handler](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/handler.ex) module, that acts as a router for the requests.
The server replies with JSON objects or HTML, depending on the endpoint that's matched on the router.
Some routes to try:
- /pledges
- /sensors
- /404s holds the routes requested by the user but weren't found
- and more..

### GenServer Modules

[Supervisor](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/supervisor.ex) supervises:
- [ServicesSupervisor](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/services_supervisor.ex)
- [KickStarter](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/kick_starter.ex)
  - supervises the non OTP process: HttpServer


[ServicesSupervisor](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/services_supervisor.ex) supervises:

- [Sensor GenServer](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/sensor_server.ex)
- [Pledge GenServer](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/pledge_server.ex)
- [404's Counter GenServer](https://github.com/joaquinipar/servy/blob/main/lib/servy/counter.ex)
